# Building a Korean-to-English Translator from Scratch

This project implements a Korean-to-English machine translation system from scratch using the Transformer architecture. It covers the full pipeline, including tokenizer usage, custom dataset processing, Transformer model implementation, training, evaluation, and final translation.

---

## Project Overview

### Tokenizer Usage and Theory

* Using **Hugging Face tokenizers**
* Understanding **BPE (Byte Pair Encoding)**

### 1. Pretrained Model Trial

* Try out the pretrained **MarianMTModel** from Hugging Face for comparison

---

## Dataset Preparation

### AI Hub Korean-English Dialogue Data

* Load and process **parallel dialogue data**
* Create a **custom dataset class**
* Build a **PyTorch DataLoader**

---

## 2. Transformer Model Implementation (From Scratch)

## Performance Metrics

### Evaluation Metrics

* Calculate **Perplexity** to measure model confidence
* Use **BLEU Score** to assess translation quality
